# Surfs-Up
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to help W. Avy to give him more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Data
The total temperature count for June was a 1700; with a mean of 74.9, standard deviation of 3.25, and the highest temperature for June going up to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

The toal temperature count for December was 1517; with a mean of 71.04, standard deviation of 3.74, and the highest temperature for December going up to 83 degree Fahrenheit. The standard deviation difference between the two months (seasons) is 0.5

## Conclusion
Based on the research, there isn't enough data information at the time to determine what time of the year to open the shop because of other factors that can affect the decision for W. Avy. Having to do with weather, I would like to quire on the wind/gusts, precipitation, when the hurricane/cyclone seasons are, what time of the year has better waves as opposed to unsafe and dangerous types of waves.
